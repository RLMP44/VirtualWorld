This is a personal project in which I create a virtual world and populate it with self-driving cars.
It is a work in progress and there is more to come!

Currently, we are able to draw roads on the map and then place houses on either side of the road provided there is adequate space.
We can also auto generate trees provided they do not overlap with other items.
